               <h1 style="color:#6c757d;">Tourism in Maldives</h1>

<p>Have you ever answered the question – if you were stuck on an island, what would you bring? Books, people, food, some form of entertainment. Well, luckily, the island we’re going to describe today needs none of the above. You only step onto the soft, warm sand of the beaches, feel the blue green waves slip under your feet and in between your toes, hear the beat of the music, smell the lime, coconut and chilly of a tangy fish soup to understand that this island nation needs nothing to make it better.
<br><br>
So, if there was ever an island to be stuck on (or visit) the Maldives it is. Today, we’re going to give you a small insight into this ocean bound treasure. We’ll dive under the water, we’ll walk the streets, learn about the history and explore the best of Maldives Tourism
<br><br>

   <h1 style="color:#6c757d;">Highlights Of Maldives</h1>

<h2 style="color:#6c757d;">Cities And Islands In Maldives</h2>

<p>The Maldives island nation is a cluster of precious jewels – discovering each of them is a pleasure and delight. Start with Malé – the capital city. Thrumming with energy, this is a city filled with beautiful buildings, like the 17th century Friday Mosque, energetic markets like Male Market and the lovely Mulee aage Palace. Cross the sparkling waters that surround Male and you’ll arrive at the Hulhumale Island, with its spectacular beaches, glass topped mosque, a beautiful promenade and serene, green neighbourhoods. If you’re going slightly off the well-trodden path, then Maafushi is the destination to visit. Once ravaged by the tsunami, this island is climbing back on its feet, with a variety of beautiful resorts springing up. This is a quiet, beautiful pocket of the world to tuck yourself into. Stroll on the beaches, laze at the guesthouse and enjoy coffee at its small coffeehouses. For a little history, head to the northernmost of the Maldivian island chains to the island of Utheemu – once the home of Sultan Mohammed Thakurufaanu, the leader who drove the Portuguese invaders from the islands in the 16th century. Other places to visit are Feydhoo, Maradhoo, Veligandu Island, Banana Reef, Thulusdhoo Island and more.

<h2 style="color:#6c757d;">Best Time To Visit Maldives</h2>

<p>The sun loves Maldives! Blue skies, gentle waves and the warm sun - perfect weather for all those great beach days. However, the best time to visit this island nation is from November to April (with the best weather conditions peaking between December and March). The Maldives do experience a monsoon season – between May and October. The rains hamper a lot of activity around the beaches and in the water, so it’s best to book your tickets for the drier season.
