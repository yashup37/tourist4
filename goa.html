    <p>Goa has been a key destination for Christian Pilgrimage tours in India. Goa was a part of the Mauryan Empire, around 3rd century BC. The Satvahanas of Kolhapur, and later the Chalukyas of Badami, took over the governance. Other dynasties followed, including a short-lived Muslim invasion, until the Vijaynagar Empire established itself for almost a century. This era, too, ended with the arrival of the Sultans of Gulbarga, from whom the rule passed on to the Adil Shah of Bijapur. Soon, the Dutch, English, French and Portuguese, all began struggling for its possession. Ultimately, in 1510, the Portuguese conquered Goa, with Alfonso de Albuquerque leading the invasion. Having ruled for around four centuries, in 1961, fourteen years after the country's independence, the Portuguese had to leave Goa.
