               <h1 style="color:#6c757d;">Tourism in Dubai</h1>

<br><br>

The City of Gold is known for its amazing architecture, breath-taking landmarks, the magnificent shopping festival (of course) and the warmth of its people.

Within the land and the sea lies some of the best-known attractions and places to see in Dubai; the buildings, the hotels, the malls, the festivals, parks.
<br><br>

 <h2 style="color:#6c757d;">Dubai Geography</h2>

 <p>Located on the Persian Gulf, Dubai the northeastern part of the United Arab Emirates. It is the second largest emirate with about more than 70 percent urban population.
</p>

<h2 style="color:#6c757d;">Dubai History</h2>

<p>Every place has a history and the foundation of Dubai was built on it. Before the glitz and glamour and of course the opulence, at the beginning of the 20th century, Dubai was a fishing village and a successful port. Back then, the Souks in Dubai were large and bustling with a steady throng of visitors and businessmen.
<br><br>
In the 1960s, when oil was discovered in the region, Dubai’s fate took a drastic turn. The then ruler of Dubai emirate, His Highness Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, decided to give a complete face-change to the charming city. He went on to develop and completely overhaul the existing infrastructure to turn it into a bustling and every-growing megapolis and amongst one of the best cities in the world.
<br><br>
In the early 1990s, Dubai’s administrative powers took a strategic decision to emerge as a major international-quality tourism destination. The investments they made in tourism infrastructure have paid off handsomely over the years as tourism in Dubai has increased multiple folds.
<br><br>
</p>

<h2 style="color:#6c757d;">Dubai Religion</h2>

<p>The culture of Dubai, in a world, is global. However, there are certain things you should keep in mind. People here speak English and Arabic and language won’t be a barrier. While the residents of Dubai follow Islam, they welcome visitors with a smile and respect.
<br><br>
However, they are still a bit conservative in nature and it is best to follow their rules and regulations, as you are just a guest in their hometown. You will need to follow their etiquette. No matter where you go, you need to be appropriately dressed. This is applicable to both men and women.
<br><br>
Avoid public display of affection, as it is frowned upon. You will be arrested for causing a disturbance if you are caught drunk in a public place. If you have plans to visit the Jumeirah mosque, make sure you cover your head.The people in Dubai take their laws very seriously and if you are caught doing anything illegal, you will be severely punished.
<br><br>
</p>

<h2 style="color:#6c757d;">Dubai Population</h2>

<p>Dubai is a male-dominated society, with the number of males considerably higher than the number of females. The population of Dubai as of now stands at 2.885 million and has a density of about eight times than the entire country. Only 15 percent of this population is made up of UAE nationals. However, the rest of the population is all about the migrants and expatriates.
